## 📖 Overview

HCP Nexus AI Assistant is an AI-powered Healthcare Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform designed for Medical Representatives and Healthcare Professionals.

Instead of manually entering doctor visit details into traditional CRM systems, users can simply describe their interactions using natural language. The LangGraph-powered assistant intelligently extracts structured information, records interactions, retrieves previous visit history, provides AI-generated insights, and recommends follow-up actions.

The project demonstrates how conversational AI can streamline healthcare workflows while reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy.
